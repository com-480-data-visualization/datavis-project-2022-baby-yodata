You may dispense with the pleasantries, Commander. I'm here to put you back on schedule.Perhaps I can find new ways to motivate them.The Emperor does not share your optimistic appraisal of the situation.Then perhaps you can tell him when he arrives.That is correct, Commander. And he is most displeased with your apparent lack of progress.I hope so, Commander, for your sake. The Emperor is not as forgiving as I am.The Death Star will be completed on schedule.Yes, my Master.As you wish.What is thy bidding, my Master?What of the reports of the Rebel fleet massing near Sullust?Yes, my Master.Where is that shuttle going?Do they have a code clearance?No. Leave them to me. I will deal with them myself.The Emperor will see me, now!A small Rebel force has penetrated the shield and landed on Endor.My son is with them.I have felt him, my Master.They are clear, my Master.He will come to me?As you wish.Good work, Commander. Leave us. Conduct your search and bring his companions to me.The Emperor has been expecting you.So, you have accepted the truth.That name no longer has any meaning for me.I see you have constructed a new lightsaber.Your skills are complete. Indeed, you are powerful, as the Emperor has foreseen.Obi-Wan once thought as you do.You don't know the power of the dark side. I must obey my master.If that is your destiny.It is too late for me, son. The Emperor will show you the true nature of the Force. He is your master now.His lightsaber.It is pointless to resist, my son.Obi-Wan has taught you well.You are unwise to lower your defenses.There is no conflict.You underestimate the power of the dark side. If you will not fight, then you will meet your destiny.You cannot hide forever, Luke.Give yourself to the dark side. It is the only way you can save your friends. Yes, your thoughts betray you. Your feelings for them are strong. Especially for...Sister! So...you have a twin sister. Your feelings have now betrayed her, too. Obi-Wan was wise to hide her from me. Now his failure is complete. If you will not turn to the dark side, then perhaps she will.Luke, help me take this mask off.Nothing can stop that now. Just for once... let me look on you with my own eyes.
